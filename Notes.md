## Makefiles
Makefiles are tools used for automating the building task.
They have variables called **Macros**

A macro can be initialized as 
```makefile
CC = gcc
```
conventionaly CC is the program to be executed. We can define any value as a macro
```makefile
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = " -v "
```
Then we have something called a process. A process can be defined with the files that are being affected.
```makefile
main: main.c function.c
    $(CC) $? $(CFLAGS) -o $@.o
```
Tha make program will just fill in the macros and execute any command. The Macros will be distributed as:
* ``$(CC)`` and ``$(CFLAGS)`` will split out the values of the variables
* ``$?`` will give the changed filenames.
* ```$@``` will give the current process name in this case *main* 


## Variable Scopes

### Global variables

Global variables are defined in the top of a file and outside of any function

```c
#include <stdio.h>


int multip = 10; // This is a global variable 

void printmult(){
    printf("The Multiplier is %d\n",multip);
}

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    printf("%d\n",multip);
    printmult();
    return 0;
}
```
*Here all the functions inside the file can access the variable*
