## Makefiles
Makefiles are tools used for automating the building task.
They have variables called **Macros**

A macro can be initialized as 
```makefile
CC = gcc
```
conventionaly CC is the program to be executed. We can define any value as a macro
```makefile
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = " -v "
```
Then we have something called a process. A process can be defined with the files that are being affected.
```makefile
main: main.c function.c
    $(CC) $? $(CFLAGS) -o $@.o
```
Tha make program will just fill in the macros and execute any command. The Macros will be distributed as:
* ``$(CC)`` and ``$(CFLAGS)`` will split out the values of the variables
* ``$?`` will give the changed filenames.
* ```$@``` will give the current process name in this case *main* 


## Variable Scopes

### Global variables

Global variables are defined in the top of a file and outside of any function

```c
#include <stdio.h>


int multip = 10; // This is a global variable 

void printmult(){
    printf("The Multiplier is %d\n",multip);
}

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    printf("%d\n",multip);
    printmult();
    return 0;
}
```
*Here all the functions inside the file can access the variable*

### External variables
External variables are variables which are declared in a file and can be accessed across any file in the project.

This is the *fun.c* file 
```c
#include "functions.h"
#include <stdio.h>

extern int myextern;  // The external variable is defined here

void getmyextern(){
    printf("%d\n",myextern);
}
```

The *main.c* file is: 
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "functions.h"

int myextern = 10; // This is the initialisation

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    printf("%d\n",myextern); // Output: 10
    getmyextern(); // Output: 10
    return 0;
}
```

## Header file uses
* A program can be divided into individual files and that can be maintained easyly.

* Macros , functions , enums and structers are all can be defined in a header file 
eg:
```c
extern int hello;
int myfunc(int a);
void getmyextern();
```

## Memory types
### Stack memory
* Memory that is used inside a function. 
* Locally available so easy to track.
* Uses LIFO (last in first out) method to save variables.
* Allocated and freed automatically.
### Heap memory
- Have a hierarchial structure.
- A larg pool which is used dynamicaly
- Managed by programer (not automatic)
- Accessed using pointers
- Created using ```malloc()```
- Deleted using ```free()```
- Restriction is only the physical size of memory.
- Global 
- Slower
### How to selct

|  Stack | Heap  |
|---|---|
|  For small memory |  When need larger memory |
| When only need to persist when the function is alive | When to keep the data for a long time |
| Easier and faster | When to allocate data dynamically (arrays,struct) |

# Section 5
## Storage classes
classified with respect to it's scope,visiblity and lifetime.
### Auto variable 
- The lifetime is defined automatically. 
- A variable in a function or loop is defaultly automatic.
- Because the default ```auto``` keyword is not used that much.

eg:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    for (int i = 0;i<=10;i++){
        auto int age = 18;
        printf("%d",age);
    }
    // age is destroyed when exited the loop 
}
```
### Extern variable
- The lifetime is as the program exits.
- Can initialize an external variable with a legal value where it declared.
- Can be accessed within files.
- every fle must reinitialize them to use. But the value will be same everywhere.

fun.c file:
```c
#include "functions.h"
#include <stdio.h>

extern int myextern;  // The extern varable is defined

void getmyextern(){
    printf("%d\n",myextern); // can be accessed in the same file
}
```

main.c file:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "functions.h"


int myextern = 10;  // The variable is initialized.


int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    printf("%d\n",myextern); // can be used in the same file
    getmyextern();
    return 0;
}

```

When using arrays we dont have to give the dimention of the size while defining an extern variable.

fun.c file:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

extern char password[];
void printpass(void){
    printf("%s\n",password);
}
```
main.c file:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "functions.h"

char password[30] = "12345";
void printpass(void);

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    printf("%s\n",password);
    printpass();
    return 0;
}
```

for multi-dimentional arrays we have to specify the second size of the array.
```c
extern int data[][10];
```
This denotes a multi dimentional array with 10 fixed columns and as many rows as we initialize.

We can make functions also  



# Section 6
## Advanced Datatypes
### Variable length arrays
A variable length array have the length of an expression executed at the runtime.
It doesn't mean you can modify that after we create.
Just means that we can give a variable at the position of the size f the array.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    int size;
    scanf("%d",&size);
    int arr[size];
    printf("array of %d elements created.",size);
}
```
### Flexible array members
Flexible array membes is a technique where we can specify the length of the array in runtime and also we can modify it. Here is an example code.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
struct flexarr
{
    int arraysize;
    int array[];
};

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    int desiredSize = 5;
    struct flexarr * ptr;
    ptr = malloc(sizeof(struct flexarr) + desiredSize + sizeof(int));
    return 0;
}
```
### Complex Numbers
A number in the form of *a+ib*
